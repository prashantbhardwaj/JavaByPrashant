    // Here we are talking about main method of Java
    // Why main method is important - because java uses this method to run your class
    // when we run a java class, java run time goes into the class to find out the main method
    // if java RE finds the main emthod then it runs it.

    // public - access modifier which tells where this method canbe referred from
    // static - suggesting that this method can be called without the Object of this class
    // void - anything just before the name of your method is the return type.
    // And void means method doesn't return anything.

    // Things under the bracked (), are called method arguments
    // Values which we can pass inside the method
